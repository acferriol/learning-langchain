# learning-langchain

This repository contains projects and examples using [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) to explore and learn about building advanced language model applications. It includes tutorials, sample code, and experiments to help you understand how to create conversational agents, workflows, and custom tools with these frameworks.

## 🚀 Main Elements to Learn in LangChain

- **🔗 Chains**  
    Combine multiple components (prompts, models, tools) into a workflow.

- **🧩 Agents**  
    Build autonomous agents that can reason and act using tools.

- **📚 Memory**  
    Implement conversational memory for context-aware interactions.

- **🛠️ Tools & Plugins**  
    Integrate external APIs, databases, and custom functions.

- **📝 Prompts**  
    Design effective prompts for language models.

- **📦 Data Loaders**  
    Load and preprocess data from various sources.

- **🔒 Security & Privacy**  
    Handle sensitive data and ensure safe interactions.
